### What I learned

This challenge helped me become a way better JavaScript Developer, pushing me to learn how to structure my projects using the right Architecture and 
Design Pattern, the best way of working with data, to store data, and to control the state changes and update data. I also could pratice some of the most 
useful Array Methods and advanced Dom-manipulation and Dom-traversing.

On this project also I used Objected Oriented Programing based on ES6 Classes, that helped me learn so much, and definately become a better developer.
